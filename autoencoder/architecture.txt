the deep learning architecture, the generation of importance map, the quantization and arthematic coder in the system1 !

the network architecture
---
input -> H x W --> RGB

the encoder block -->
kernel = 5
channels = 64
stride = 2

all layers are liner convolutions
normalization --> [-1,1] or [0,1] not confirm


and the decoder goes in the inverse direction !!

the encoder results -->
gives z --> feature maps

the quantizer
---
input -> z --> feature maps

giver q = Q(z)

the importance net 
---
input --> z
imp = I(z)

then we have Z' = q x imp

The decoder takes Z' as input 
X' = D(Z')


denormalization --> [0,255]


q(quantizer) = Q(z) = [z x 2^d] --> this is floor function
where d in first 4 bits if the normalized pixel
 


overview -->

###encoder
image -> (input) -> Normalize -> conv2d -> relu -> conv2d -> relu ->
15 res blocks and 5 skips -> res block -> skip -> conv2d -> z -> 

--> quantizer and importance net -> masking -> binary arithamatic code ->

### decoder
binary arithematic decode -> conv2d -> relu -> 15 res blocks and 5 skip ->
res block and 1 skip -> conv2d -> relu -> conv2d -> Denormalize -> output
